                       extract relevant data from reddit.com regarding subreddit contents, post performance, and comment
                       contents. We created CSV files of relevant data and generated pandas using the pandas libarary.

                    From our pandas we generated interactive data plots using the plotly Python library. Those plots, converted
                    to html files, are available here for your persusal. Currently we have two uploaded. The first is a ternary plot that illustrates user engagement
                       with posts regarding different topics in the r/news and r/politics subreddits by plotting the relative frequency of downvotes and comments on posts
                       organized by topic. The second plot illustrates the same posts by total comments and downvotes to give a picture of what posts concerning which topics
                       drew the greatest reaction from users. It also separates the data between the two subreddits, and provides violin plots for downvote data to show how
                       downvotes differ between topics.
